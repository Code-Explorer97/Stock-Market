# Stock-Market
This Python script employs Support Vector Regression (SVR) to forecast stock prices using historical data. It employs scikit-learn's SVR implementation with linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) kernels. The script begins by parsing historical stock price data from a CSV file, preprocessing it, and then training SVR models.
