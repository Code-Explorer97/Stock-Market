# Stock Price Prediction with SVR

## Overview

This Python script predicts stock prices using Support Vector Regression (SVR) based on historical data. It employs scikit-learn's SVR with linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) kernels. The script reads historical stock price data from a CSV file, preprocesses it, trains SVR models, and visualizes predictions using matplotlib.

## Features

- Predicts stock prices using SVR with linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels.
- Reads historical stock price data from a CSV file for training.
- Generates visualizations of historical data and predicted prices with matplotlib.
- Allows users to input a specific date to obtain the predicted stock price.

## Usage

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install required libraries using pip:
3. Prepare historical stock price data in CSV format.
4. Update the file path in the `get_data` function to point to your CSV file.
5. Run the script:
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to input a date for predicting the stock price.
